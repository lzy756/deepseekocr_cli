# Specification Quality Checklist: DeepSeek-OCR CLI Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification successfully avoids implementation details. Describes CLI commands and behavior from user perspective without mentioning Node.js internals, specific libraries, or code structure.

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: 
- All 54 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- 10 success criteria defined with measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- 6 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (26 total scenarios)
- 8 edge cases identified with handling approach
- 15 assumptions documented clearly
- Scope clearly limited to single-user CLI tool for DeepSeek-OCR API

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- Each user story includes 4-5 acceptance scenarios covering normal and error flows
- User stories prioritized (P1: Image OCR & Config, P2: PDF & Batch, P3: Task Management & Health)
- Success criteria directly traceable to user stories and requirements
- Zero implementation leakage - no mention of libraries, code architecture, or technical implementation

---

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All checklist items validated successfully

**Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive functional requirements (54 FRs) organized by feature area
2. Well-structured user stories with clear priority and independent testability
3. Measurable success criteria focusing on user outcomes
4. Thorough edge case analysis
5. Clear assumptions documenting defaults and constraints

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` command - proceed to implementation planning phase

**No blocking issues found** - Specification is complete and ready for development.
